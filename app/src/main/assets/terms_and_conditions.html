downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you - you
should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app.
You're not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our

of the app, and you also shouldn't try to translate the app into other
languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade
marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related
to it, still belong to 2Get.</span></p>

is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.
For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge

the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you're
paying for.</span></p>

2Get - Shopping List Helper app stores and processes personal data that you
have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It's your responsibility
to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that
you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing
software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system
of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features
and it could mean that the 2Get - Shopping List Helper app won't work properly
or at all.</span></p>

should be aware that there are certain things that 2Get will not take
responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have
an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your
mobile network provider, but 2Get cannot take responsibility for the app not
working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't
have any of your data allowance left.</span></p>

you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that
your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply.
As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third
party charges. In using the app, you're accepting responsibility for any such
charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home
territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are
not the bill payer for the device on which you're using the app, please be
aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
using the app.</span></p>

the same lines, 2Get cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the
app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged - if it runs out
of battery and you can't turn it on to avail the Service, 2Get cannot accept
responsibility.</span></p>

respect to 2Get's responsibility for your use of the app, when you're using the

is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
information to us so that we can make it available to you. 2Get accepts no
liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</span></p>

some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on
Android - the requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide
to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you'll need to
download the updates if you want to keep using the app. 2Get does not promise
that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works
with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you
promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon
any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will
end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
